# SBaGen+ - Sequenced Brainwave Generator

SBaGen+ is a command-line tool for generating binaural beats and isochronic tones, designed to assist with meditation, relaxation, and altering states of consciousness.

## About This Project

SBaGen+ is a fork of the original SBaGen (Sequenced Binaural Beat Generator) created by Jim Peters. The original project was classified as "bitrotted" by its author, and this fork aims to continue its development by adding new features while maintaining compatibility with the original.

SBaGen+ is not intended to be a significantly different software from the original SBaGen. Instead, it's a project dedicated to keeping SBaGen alive and functional. The primary goal is to ensure that SBaGen continues to run on modern operating systems, with occasional additions of features that users have requested in the past.

The name was changed from "Sequenced Binaural Beat Generator" to "Sequenced Brainwave Generator" to better reflect the expanded capabilities of SBaGen+. With the addition of isochronic tones, which are not binaural beats, the original name would be too limiting.

## Features and Bug Fixes

- All features of original SBaGen
- Added support for ALSA output device (Linux)
- Added build scripts for Linux native ARM64/AArch64
- Isochronic tone generation (works with or without headphones)
- White noise and brown noise generation
- Support for Apple Silicon (ARM64) and Intel (x86_64)
- Fixed bug with WAV file duration when using -W option with sequence files
- Added validation for total amplitude to prevent audio distortion when exceeding 100%

## Compilation

SBaGen+ can be compiled for macOS, Linux and Windows. The build process is divided into two steps:

1. **Building the libraries**: This step is only necessary if you want MP3 and OGG support
2. **Building the main program**: This step compiles SBaGen+ using the libraries built in the previous step

### Build Scripts Structure

- **Library build scripts**:

  - `macos-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for macOS (universal binary - ARM64 + x86_64)
  - `linux-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)
  - `windows-build-libs.sh`: Builds libraries for Windows using MinGW (cross-compilation)

- **Main program build scripts**:
  - `macos-build-sbagen+.sh`: Builds SBaGen+ for macOS
  - `linux-build-sbagen+.sh`: Builds SBaGen+ for Linux (with ALSA support)
  - `windows-build-sbagen+.sh`: Builds SBaGen+ for Windows using MinGW (cross-compilation)

### Building for macOS

```bash
# Build the libraries (only needed for MP3 and OGG support)
./macos-build-libs.sh

# Build SBaGen+
./macos-build-sbagen+.sh
```

### Building for Linux

```bash
# Build the libraries (only needed for MP3 and OGG support)
./linux-build-libs.sh

# Build SBaGen+
./linux-build-sbagen+.sh
```

### Building for Windows (cross-compilation on Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Build the libraries (only needed for MP3 and OGG support)
./windows-build-libs.sh

# Build SBaGen+
./windows-build-sbagen+.sh
```

## Usage

After compilation, you will have the following binaries:

- macOS: `sbagen+-macOS`
- Linux: `sbagen+-linux32`, `sbagen+-linux64`, and `sbagen+-linux-arm64` (if you have cross-compilation tools)
- Windows: `sbagen+-win32.exe` and `sbagen+-win64.exe`

### Example usage:

```bash
# Play a simple sequence with brown noise
./sbagen+-macOS -i brown/80 200@10/08

# Play with an MP3 background file
./sbagen+-macOS -m background.mp3 -i mix/80 200@10/08
```

## Notes

- If your Linux is ARM64/AArch64, the `linux-build-sbagen+.sh` script will build a native ARM64 binary, but binary name will be `sbagen+-linux64`. Also, the library name of MP3 and OGG generated by `linux-build-libs.sh` will be `linux-x86_64-*.a`.
- If your Linux is x86_64 and you have cross-compilation tools, the `linux-build-sbagen+.sh` script will build a 64-bit binary, 32-bit binary, and a ARM64 binary.
- MP3 and OGG support is optional and requires building the corresponding libraries.
