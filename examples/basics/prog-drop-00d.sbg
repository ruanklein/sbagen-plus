## From Jim Peters:
##
##      Hour-long "-p drop" session at level 00ds+ mixed with river sounds.
##      When this level becomes 'boring', edit the file to move onto 01ds+, 
##      then 02ds+, and so on.  This can be used over months and years, 
##      gradually working through from 00 to 99, for the purposes of 
##      emotional/energetic clearing.  See SBAGEN.TXT for a full explanation.
