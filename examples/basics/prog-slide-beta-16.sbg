## From Jim Peters:
##
##      Half-hour "-p slide" session at 16Hz (beta waves) mixed with river
##	sounds.  See SBAGEN.TXT for a full explanation.  You can edit this 
##	file and adjust the +16 to try other frequencies.  This works with 
##	the same principles as the 'drop' sessions, only at 'right angles'.
